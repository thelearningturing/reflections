I as able to spot the difference instantaneously. no need to actually go through it at all. 

easy access to the entire history of the file to that i can go back to a working version and try and be brave instead of being scare of doing 
something stupid that i cud probably not recover from. 

cuz git is used for tracking change in codes

type : "git log" to see changes
changes shown are in descending order. 

to see differences in two versions, type: "git diff " and paste the two versions. 

cuz i can always revert back to a non messed up version.
