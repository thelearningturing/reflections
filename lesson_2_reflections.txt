an empty git repository is initialized
no commits are made

staging area is like an intermediate stage. is acts like a buffer so that all files from the directory will not be added to the repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by adding first to the staging area. 
when nothing is added to the staging area, running "git diff" will give the difference between the contents of the working directory and staging area. 
when content is added to the staging area using "git add <file name>" then running "git diff" again will give nothing since the staging area also
contains the same stuff as the working directory. 
running "git diff --staged" will give the difference between the staging area and the commit area. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
suppose i want to add a new feature but a afraid to make changes that cud reek havoc in a properly working project.  

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
u can track exactly at which stage the commits were made and revert to them or merge them with master
